# maze-jam
A place for NashFP to share "Maze Jam" solutions

LambdaJam 2013 was an amazing event. Brilliant keynotes, brilliant talks, and each  afternoon was a choice: either attend a workshop, or a jam session. In a Jam sessions teams formed and each team worked through a coding excercise. At the end, teams could plug into the projector and show thier solutions. This event was NashFP's soul mate in conference form. Hats off to [@puredanger](https://github.com/puredanger).

One of the Jam Sessions "Maze" was led by NashFP member [Paulmichael Blasucci](https://github.com/pblasucci).

## How to play along

From Paul's blog post "[To the A-maze-ment of All: Generating Mazes in F#](https://pblasucci.wordpress.com/2013/07/20/to-the-a-maze-ment-of-all-generating-mazes-in-f/)"

> The goal is to produce a two-dimensional rectangular maze of arbitrary size. The actual dimensions of the maze should be accepted parametrically (ex: inputs to a function, command-line arguments, et cetera). The maze itself should be outputâ€¦ as an array of arrays of integers, where each inner array represents one row of the maze and the number in each cell is a bitmask indicating the number of passages leading out of the cell (Note: the bitmask pattern is: North = 1, South = 2, East = 4, West = 8).

For example this code...
```
var maze = [
  [ 2, 14, 10, 14,  8 ],
  [ 5,  9, 11, 13, 11 ],
  [ 3, 15,  9, 15,  9 ],
  [ 7, 15, 13, 15, 11 ],
  [ 1, 13,  9,  9,  9 ]
]
```

... represents this maze

* Mark a start and end point and guarantee one path through.
* Mark a start and end point and guarantee *exactly* one path through.
